# racecourse-demo

The Racecourse Demo displays a sample set of data provided by Total Performance Data. The data represents
the real-time tracks of 8 race horses during an actual race at Lingfield race course in the UK. 

The demo comprises a Javascript Control Client that reads the data from a file and publishes it in near 
real-time, record by record, over Diffusion or Reappt using the new JSON topics released with Diffusion 
5.7. A Javascript client subscribes to the data and displays it on to Google Maps as it is received.
